A tournament can be viewed as a sorting algorithm. What would hapen if we
saw sorting algorithms as a tournaent bracket ?

A tournament is defined in Meriam-Webster dictionary as

``a series of games or contests that make up a single unit of competition (as on
a professional golf tour), the championship playoffs of a league or conference,
or an invitational event''

A compettive game has, arguably by definition, the goal to win. A
tournament in turn is a series of games to determine an ordering
between a few teams, with particular attention given to the best
team. An intresting way to look at a tournament as a sorting algorithm.


Comparing tournaments to sorting algorithms can first provide an intresting
way to present sorting algorithms, but also structure the way we think about
tournaments.

# Maximum algorithm

Unlike a sorting algorithm, a torunament is subject to a number of
real-life constraits. For example, if the goal was to determine
the best team, one could apply the usual algorithm for finding the
maximum : for an $n$-sized array, pick the first element of the
array and compare it to the next element, keep the largest one; continue
the comparaisons for all other. THis results in $n-1$ comparaison.

From a tournament prespetive this would give a series of signle
elimination games, and a bracket that looks like:

![max_tournament](.out/max_tournament.pdf)

This would make for a boring and unfair tournament. Indeed the best team would
likely have to face play many more maches that any other team. Most teams would
only ever get to play a signle match.

THere are indeed many practical differences between an algorithm and a sprots
bracket. First, fans would not enjoy it, nor would it be entirely fair that
a team only gets one attempt. This is usually adressed by having some kind of
group stage, or a round-robin, which guaratees that all teams get some minimal
number of games. This also gets at the issue that team or player ordering is
not necessairy transitive, i.e., if team $A$ beats team $B$ and tream $B$
beats team $C$, this does not imply that team $A$ has a favorable machup
against $C$. Indeed, we might well have rock-paper-scisors situtations. 

Secondly this ignores many (all) balancing constriants such as home field
advantage, referees, player exaution etc.

# Insert sort 

Undetered, we press on with perhaps the simplest sorting algorithm - insert
sort. This approach can be viewed as $n$ rounds, first round only first two
teams play. within each round a team
plays

```{r}
insert_sort <- function(x, decreasing = FALSE) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    n <- length(x)
    for (i in seq(n)) {
        for (j in rev(seq(i))) {
            if (j == 1) next
            if (x[j - 1] > x[j]) {
                tmp <- x[j - 1]
                x[j - 1] <- x[j]
                x[j] <- tmp
            } else {
                break
            }
        }
    }
    if (decreasing) {
        x <- rev(x)
    }
    x
}
x <- rpois(100, 100)
identical(sort(x), insert_sort(x))
```
