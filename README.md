# Unfair

The idea here is to compare sorting algorithms with tournament brackets. In a
way, a tournament attempts to establish an ordering between participants. Would
a sorting algorithm provide an interesting sorting mechanism? Or vice-versa,
would a tournament structure provide an interesting sorting algorithm?

In practice, I found it difficult to portray any non-trivial sorting algorithm
as a tournament bracket. Moreover, most tournament brackets are not really
sorting algorithms; it is often desirable to have every team play against every other team
at least once. There are other considerations, such as transitivity not really
being true for many games, noise in the "game" comparison.
